P3 Granularity Review
=======================

AeminiumGPU is a framework for writing java Map-Reduce operations that execute on the GPU. The framework features a compiler from Java to Java with OpenCL, and a Java library for execution.

As of today, AeminiumGPU has map and reduce primitives. The goal is to add the filter primitive using the prefix sum algorithm.
