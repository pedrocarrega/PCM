P9 Parallel Genetic Programming Classifier
==========================================

Write a parallel classifier for Machine Learning workloads that uses Genetic Programming. Genetic programming is a subset of Genetic Algorithms that uses ASTs to represent programs:

(x+1) * 10 + 3 - y would be an expression that would translate features x and y into a classification (closer to 0 is classA, closer to 1 is classB). 

Evaluate your solution in both performance and time against state of the art approaches.
