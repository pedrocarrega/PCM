P12 Benchmarking frameworks considering energy
==============================================

In this study [1] different programming languages were compared with regards to energy efficiency. The goal for this project is to do the same, but for parallel frameworks.

The idea is to write (or find) a few programs in different frameworks (Cilk, OpenMP, etc...) and evaluate the energy consumption.
