PCM Project
===========


1. Groups
---------

This project can (and should) be done in groups of 2 students. However, the grade is individual and will depend on the performance of each student on the oral presentation.

2. Goal
-------

The goal of this project is to write a 6-8 page paper on one of the possible topics. Each topic has its own challenges: some could have more of literature reading while others will require more programming. But all require a fair amount of writing.


3. Topics
---------

Different proposed topics are available on different files. Students are also free to suggest their own topics, but must be approved by the teaching staff.

Topics are selected on a first come, first served basis, and students are allowed to rethink their decision within one week, freeing the topic for other groups.

4. Continuous Feedback
----------------------

Doing all the work the two days before the deadline is a recipe for a bad grade.

You should either send in two drafts or arrange two meetings with the instructor. Failing to do so will naturally result in more in-depth questions at the presentation.


6. Deadline
-----------

You should submit your final version via email:

```
To: docentes-pcm@listas.di.ciencias.ulisboa.pt
Subject: Final_Project
```

*DEADLINE:* January 22th, 2018 AOE

You should include your paper and any source code used or developed (including bash scripts for testing).

7. Presentation
---------------

The project presentations will happen January 24nd, either during the morning or the afternoon.

Each project will have up to 20 minutes to present. Students will be cut off after 20 minutes. For groups of 2, you should try to divide the presentation in a way that makes sense, so both students present.

After each presentation, there will be 20 minutes of questions asked by:

- Other PCM Students
- At least two professors from the Department
- Other guests (like PhD students)

Each question might be directed at one particular element of the group. Be sure to be comfortable with all of the work. You might redirect the question to your colleague, but if this happens consistently, it will have a large negative impact on your grade.

8. Grading
----------

You will be graded based on:

- Level of accomplishment of the assignment (Be sure to check with the instructor if you are doing OK on this)
- Technical language (both in writing and during the presentation)
- Evaluation strategy (correct benchmarking)
- Presentation quality


Understand that subjectivity will have a large weight on your grade, just like real world. Two instructors will be present to make if as fair as possible.
